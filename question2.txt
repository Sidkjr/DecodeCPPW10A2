You have a sorted array of infinite numbers, how would you search an element in the array?

Ans: 

    Since we cannot keep the high value as (n-1), i.e 'n' representing the size of the array since we have an infinite array. 
    The way we can approach to solve this problem is that we can consider the first element as the high as well the low to 
    perform binary search.

    Now the case being that we keep on expanding our search scope until the target value is found, to achieve faster search we
    can double or triple the search scope everytime the calculated mid value is less than the target.
